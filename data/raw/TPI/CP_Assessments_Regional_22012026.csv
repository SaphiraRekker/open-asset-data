In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from electricity generation and compare the company's electricity-specific pathway to TPI's electricity-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration.

In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from electricity generation and compare the company's electricity-specific pathway to TPI's electricity-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration.

When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions.",,,,0.71476923,0.713560837,0.686389948,0.652980495,0.583980301,0.525680631,0.488338923,0.470898247,0.453457571,0.436016895,0.418576219,0.401135543,0.383694868,0.366254192,0.348813516,0.33137284,0.313932164,0.296491489,0.279050813,0.261610137,0.244169461,0.226728785,0.20928811,0.191847434,0.174406758,0.156966082,0.139525406,0.122084731,0.104644055,0.087203379,0.069762703,0.052322027,0.034881352,0.017440676,0.0
